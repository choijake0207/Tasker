# TASKer

## Overview

Tasker is a personal kanban-board application built with React.js, designed to give users customizability over their tasks and work flow. Tasker utilizes the "@dnd-kit" library for its drag-and-drop functionality allowing users to migrate tasks to different working stages seamlessly. User information is stored into their browser's localStorage for persistent data preservation across multiple sessions

### Personal Note

Tasker is merely a self-excersise so that I could become familiar with the @dnd-kit library as well as integrate state management in different contexts. I consider this project to still be a "work-in-progress" as I continue to add features, improve UI, and experiment with other libraries. 

### Built With
* React.js
* "@dnd-kit/core"

## Pending/Potential Improvements
- [ ] implementation of useSortable hook to animate task movements
- [ ] implement user authentication
- [ ] fullstackify entire project with MySql, Sequelizer, and Node.js
